# SinWaveColorMap

A tool for manipulating sin waves to produce color map LUTs that can be applied to graphs and images. The tool relies on matplotlib for the GUI and openCV for saving the colormap thus avoiding some awkward file formats.

As part of my work on the mandelbrot web app I utilised a simple trick for producing randomised color maps. I decided a graphical representation of this might be nice.

You can use this tool to create custom cuslor maps by tweaking the parameters of three sine waves, one for each of the RGB values.

The colormap is easily saved and applied to images or graphs as can be seen in the next screenshot
